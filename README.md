This is a fork of react project by John Smilga. I have added my code under the setup directory. The corresponding readme file also contains the link to live hosting of app.

This was done as part of practice and with the aim of getting better at React.

HTML and CSS and a bit of starting boilerplate code was provided by John. My task was to write the code only specific to the react.

Axios was used to fetch the data from APIs in few projects.
